_**Assistant**_

I'll help you build your 4D game for multiple platforms (Mac, Web, and Windows). Let me first examine your current setup and then provide solutions for each platform.


---

Read file: src/9.4d_game/main.cpp

---

Read file: src/9.4d_game/game.hpp

---

Now let me check the current build setup and create comprehensive build configurations for all three platforms.
